Rationale
---------

`happyGISCO` is a simple interface API to Eurostat GISCO web-services. 

    
The background motivation for `happyGISCO` implementation and development is developed in the following paper: 

	Grazzini J., Museux J.-M. and Hahn M. (2018): **`Empowering and interacting with statistical produsers: A practical example with Eurostat data as a service <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325973362_Empowering_and_interacting_with_statistical_produsers_a_practical_example_with_Eurostat_data_as_a_service>`_**, submitted to *Conference of European Statistics Stakeholders*.

Ultimately, `happyGISCO` should be distributed as a lightweight containerized computing notebook where a `Python` kernel is running and where the module `happygisco` is distributed.
