Rationale
---------

`happyGISCO` is a simple interface API to Eurostat GISCO web-services. Online documentation is available on *readthedocs* (this site): http://happygisco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

    
The background motivation for `happyGISCO` implementation and development is developed in the following paper: 

	Grazzini J., Museux J.-M. and Hahn M. (2018): `**Empowering and interacting with statistical produsers: A practical example with Eurostat data as a service** <>`_, submitted to _Conference of European Statistics Stakeholders_.

Ultimately, `happyGISCO` should be distributed as a lightweight containerized computing notebook where a `Python` kernel is running and where the module `happygisco` is distributed.
